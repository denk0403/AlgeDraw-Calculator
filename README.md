Is mental math difficult for you? Are you tired of the small and hard to press buttons on your current Fitbit calculator app? Don't you wish it was easier to use? 😫

Well, no need to fear anymore because AlgeDraw is the first twelve function calculator on Fitbit with the ability to read HANDWRITTEN DIGITS using an advanced custom-made AI! 

# Features 
- 👆 Use your finger to draw and input digits one at a time.
- 🔢 Load commonly used constants like e, π, and φ.
- ⚫️ Work with decimals using the built-in decimal button.
- ↩️ Undo inputs or loaded constants with the back button.
- 🔄 Switch between radians and degrees for your trigonometric needs.
- ➕ Access 12 different functions to solve any algebra or simple trigonometry problem.
- 📚 Save all computations automatically to the stack (per session) and retrieve them for large calculations.

_Note: A consistent phone connection is required to use this app._
